# Project Overview

The entire process of creating a basic machine learning project will be covered in this project. Developing a hypothesis, assembling the model, and calculating error are all included in this. By the time you're done, you'll know how to use Jupyter and Python to create a machine learning project from start to finish.

We'll utilise a fun dataset to add some interest to this. We will make advantage of past Olympic statistics. Using statistics from the past and present, we will attempt to forecast the number of medals a nation will receive.

# Machine learning project steps

This outline is typical to most machine learning projects, and it will be followed here as well.  You may handle any machine learning challenge with the aid of this outline.


**Project Steps**

1. Create a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. Modify the data, if required, to make your desired prediction.
4. Cleaning the data for Machine Learning
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.
